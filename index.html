<p>
    I'm Garrett Tetrault, a data engineer and math enthusiast working in the enterprise service space.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated from Cornell University in 2020 with honors in Mathematics.
    My academic interests range from computer science to applied mathematics.
    Broadly, I find mathematical modeling and the tools involved really interesting.

    In my free time, I like to read and stay active.
    Skateboarding has always been a favorite of mine, but I just enjoy getting outside.

    For reading, I typically go for survey books to see how problems are approached in different fields.
    To relax, I love a good science fiction series.
    My current favorite is the &quot;Remembrance of Earth's Past&quot; trilogy by Liu Cixin.
