I'm Garrett Tetrault, a data scientist and math enthusiast working in the enterprise service space.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2020 with honors in Mathematics.
My academic interests range from computer science to applied mathematics.
Broadly, I find mathematical modeling and the tools involved really interesting.

In my free time, I like to read and stay active. 
Skateboarding has always been a favorite of mine, but I just enjoy getting outside.

For reading, I typically go for survey books to see how problems are approached in different fields.
To relax, I love a good science fiction series.
My current favorite is the "Remembrance of Earth's Past" trilogy by Liu Cixin.
